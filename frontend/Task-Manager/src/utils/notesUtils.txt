What is axiosInstance?
1.axiosInstance is a custom configured instance of Axios — a promise-based HTTP client for making API requests (GET, POST, etc.) in JavaScript/React/Node.js.

✅ Add request/response interceptors (e.g., for logging, error handling, refresh tokens).
✅ DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself) — cleaner and reusable code
