profilephotoselector----

we are creating a profile picture uoloader where the user can see a preview image, change a photo or remove it all with clean icons based buttons.

You’re designing the component to be controlled by props: image and setImage.
This means:
The actual image file is stored in the parent component’s state.
The selector component only displays and updates it, making it reusable and flexible.


When a user selects an image:
JavaScript generates a temporary local URL to preview the image (without uploading it).
This gives a smooth user experience by immediately showing what they selected.
This URL is stored in previewUrl via React’s useState.
It doesn’t persist after page refresh — it’s for display purposes only.


Instead of directly showing a <input type="file" />, you hide it and control it via a ref.
This allows you to create a custom styled "Upload" button using icons, which when clicked, triggers the hidden file input — giving better UX and design flexibility.

You’re using Lucide React icons (LuUser, LuUpload, LuTrash) to:
Show a default avatar if no photo is selected.
Represent actions (upload and remove) with clean, intuitive buttons.
This makes your component modern and user-friendly.

When the "Remove" button is clicked:
Both the selected file (image) and its preview (previewUrl) are cleared.
The file input is also reset, so the user can re-upload the same file again.
This ensures no leftover state, avoiding common bugs.
